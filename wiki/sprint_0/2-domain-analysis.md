### Warehouse Photos and Analysis

Our project targets items organization on the shelves.

These industrial shelves are called **Racks** they are famous in the sector because of their mobility and adaptability, without compromising weight capabilities, they supply to their owners. Racks are easily configured to adjust the warehouse to dynamic necessities.

Racks can be abstracted in a more suggestive word to IT Engineers as a matrix whose content is easily configurated and whose cell can mutate their location without much overhead. 

Some photos of the interior of this PSA warehouse, kindly supplied to us by Filipa Barros, are the following:

### Group Organization and Dynamics


Our group will follow a Scrum methodology to execute the goal we proposed ourselves. To achieve this Scrum approach several minor techniques will be adopted, one major one will be a Github Flow organization of our repository.

In the DS course, the first sprints will be executed by four different groups. All groups share the same vision, we need to update the efficiency of this warehouse to be smarter and more resilient to human errors that cost a price higher than the one wished by the company headers, but working in four different, well-defined verticals:

1. Optimization,
2. Warehouse Digital Tween,
3. IOT Mess Comunication,
4. Sensors Data Collection and Processing.

The last Scrum sprints will target the integration in a unique tool that united will make this warehouse more efficient and well organized.
