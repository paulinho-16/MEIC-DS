## Sprint 0

Sprint 0 represented the kickoff of DS course. During it, we formed our group and made several class meeting with the client to get a initial vision of what the problematic and how we could insert ourselves in it in order to manage a solution.

Unlike other groups, non of the members knew each other. Sprint 0 forced to extra social meeting in order to ice break the environment inside the groups


### Planning

* Group formation.

* Define a communication strategy.

* Definition of the roles of PO and SM.

* Definition of our project vertical.

* Social meeting. To everybody know each other.

* Explore and execute the tasks required for evaluation in this sprint in the course dashboard.


### Review

* We were able to know each other better. Everyone was friendly to the idea that was required to share additional empathy towards other group members at the kickoff.

* Definition of our vertical, an optimization task.

* Election of one PO and one SM.

* We were able to access all materials and technologies that were mandatory (github and docker).

* Consulted the dashboard and defined the following wiki items:    
    * [Product Vistion](1-vision.md)
    * [Domain Analysis](2-domain-analysis.md)
    * [Architecture](3-architecture.md)
    * [Risks](4-risks.md)
    * [Market Search](5-market_search.md)
    * [Git Workflow](6-git_workflow.md)

* Gather feedback from previous year students of the course, to better understand what can easily go wrong.


### What to do Next

* Load a Docker environment

* Divide the members in sub teams


### Retrospective

#### Positive Topics

* All issues were
* The group was motivated as well as all the class.
* The mindset within the class was good.
* Relevant questions were made to the client since the kickoff to easily obtain the information required to start coding.

#### Meh Topics

* Our group didn't know each other before. There weren't work mechanics previously existant like in other groups.

#### Topics to work on

* The client had very imprecise information. More questions were required.
* Neither PO, neither SM had past experience in working in that task. It was required further exploration in what should it's job be.
* Work dedication was very unbalanced. Better distribution was required.


## Sprint 1

### Planning

* Setup of a Docker environment.
* Definition of a Github workflow. 
* Definition of mockups of the layouts we were required.
* Generation of mock database that could support the genetic algorithm needs to execute it's job.
* Generation of the first mock data elements.
* Execution of the first metric in the genetic algorithm: weight.


### Review

* We defined together with the rest of the class students a [git work flow](6-git_workflow)
* We setuped a first version of docker environment that allowed members to start their coding working.
* We were able to define a first version of a database supporting the model required in our vertical.
* Weight metric was created.
* A first mock warehouse was generated allowing the execution of the genetic algorithm.
* Boot a web pipeline.


### What to do Next

* Data that could support new metrics.
* Testing the results of the logic side in realistic scenarios.
* Be able to execute the genetic algorithm that runs in python from the user friendly web frontend.
* Capability of watching the results outputed in frontend, at the moment their our only shell prints.

### Retrospective

#### Positive Topics

* A first version of the genetic algorithm with a satisfactory result was achieved

* Motivation remained high withing the group and class.


#### Meh Topics

* The overlap between groups dilemma started to show up.

* Web side development issues were ambigous and progression was slow. The task of visualization shouldn't be our responsability, but it wasn't ready any sort of visualization that could be integrated from team 3.

* Using Docker development wasn't easy to implement at 100%.


#### Topics to work on

* Mockups revealed useless, since there wasn't no time to separate the tasks of layout desingning and code.
* Unit Testing of the many components of our project.
* Better communication between groups.



## Sprint 2

### Planning

* Use gRPC to connect frontend to genetic algorithm.
* Finish result representation.
* Design optimization metrics to: work.
