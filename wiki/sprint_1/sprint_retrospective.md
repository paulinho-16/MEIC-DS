# Sprint 1 Retrospective

In a Scrum approach to software development like the one we follow, Sprint 1 is the first sprint where developers code.

### Methodology

This document contains an overall balance of the work performed during the last two weeks and is the result of the weekly agile meeting our group schedule every Friday.

### Group Happiness

By the end of the first sprint, all members of the team consider themselves happy with the methodology followed. Have a positive review of the work of its peers. Evaluate as positive the performance of the PO and the Scrum Master in keeping all elements synchronized and motivated.

 In the first sprint, the issues completed were:

 * Web Team: Layout Design | Page for Visualization of Future Results | Page to Issue the Algorithm
 * Genetic Algorithm Team: Create the architecture | Implement the Weight Metric.
 * Backend Team: Create Mock Data SQL Structure | Generated 3 mock warehouses to feed the Genetic Team with Data.

 ### Start Stop Continue

 Start:
 
 **As a team we should start:**
* Unit Test our code.
* Generate more documentation.
* Estimate more realistic the effort of each task.

Stop:
**As a team we should stop:**
* Not communicating proactively with other teams.
* Neglecting the importance of documentation.

Continue:
**As a team we will continue:**
* Well synchronized with the internal work of the genetic, backend and web team.
* The weekly meetings are being incredible moments for discussion.
* The communication with the client is productive.
