# Vision

### Manufactures evolute in paradigms. We aim to ensure our client jumps in Industry 4.0 to its full potential.

Imagine a dynamic warehouse operated by hundreds of coworkers inputting and outputting parts every day. Now imagine a warehouse that automatically adjusts itself to the needs of those coworkers. A place that fit the humans operating there, not the humans adjusting to the place. That is our objective.

In 1962, the philosopher Thomas Kuhn on its famous, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions", states that science only evolutes truly when a revolutionary event occur, which he calls "Paradigm".

Industries have witnessed three paradigms:  

1. The coal revolution: Provided the energy required to fund them. 

2. The oil paradigm: Increase the scope of materials available for manufacturing.

3. Electricity: Created the possibility of a global scale economy. 

Now it's time for the fourth industrial revolution, using AI as a means for a huge gain in productivity and efficiency. We will ensure our client jumps in this unstoppable train to infinity and beyond.
