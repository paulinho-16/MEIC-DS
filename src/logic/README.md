# Optimization metrics

- **Weight Optimization** - Heavier products are located closer to the ground, to be more easily picked by the fork-lift machine.
- **Work Optimization** - Heavier products should be more easily reachable by the worker.
- **Frequency Optimization** - Condense the occupied space so that the worker travels the minimum number of sections, by grouping the most frequent products, minimizing the necessary time and space.
- **Minimize Errors Optimization** - Whether on restocking or the collection, by keeping products of the same category further away from each other, and if that is not possible, avoid grouping products with similar dimensions (weight, height, width).
- **Organization Optimization** - Group products of the same category together, so that the warehouse is organized in a simple and human-friendly way, increasing restocking speed (ex: painting, screws, chassis products).
