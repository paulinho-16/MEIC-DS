# Optimization metrics

- **Weight Optimization** - Heavier products are located closer to the ground, to be more easily picked by the fork-lift machine.
- **Work Optimization** - Heavier products should be more easily reachable by the worker.
- **Time/Space Optimization** - Condense the occupied space so that the worker travels the minimum number of sections, by grouping the most frequent products.
- **Minimizing Errors** - Whether on restocking or the collection, by keeping similar products further away from each other.
- **Organization Optimization** - Group products of the same type/goal together, so that the warehouse is organized in a simple and human-friendly way, increasing restocking speed (ex: painting, screws, chassis products).
- **Hardware Optimization** - Place most used products close to the windows so they can recharge using solar panels.
