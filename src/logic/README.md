# Optimization metrics

- **Weight Optimization** - Heavier products should be more easily reachable by the worker
- **Time/Space Optimization** - Condense the occupied space so that the worker travels the minimum number of sections
- **Minimizing Errors** - Whether on restocking or the collection, by keeping similar products further away from each other
- **Hardware Optimization** - Place most used products close to the windows so they can recharge using solar panels
