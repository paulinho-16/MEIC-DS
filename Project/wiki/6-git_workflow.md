# Git Workflow

Scrum Masters defined at the beginning of the course that the git strategy should be github flow.

* Each of the 4 teams should start their branches with tX_...., in our case t4_...
* Every team has it's own tX_development branch that serve as a master clone to each of group in the developing stage.
* Upon integration, a new development branch should appear to join teams.
